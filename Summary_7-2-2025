Project Omega – LoRA Fine-Tuning Summary
==============================================

1. Conda Environment Setup
   - Created and renamed the Conda environment to `omega`.
   - Installed Python 3.8 dependencies: torch, torchvision, torchaudio, cudatoolkit=11.8.

2. GPU Verification
   - Verified CUDA availability on RTX 4070.
   - Installed and tested `distilgpt2` inference locally.

3. Train Script (`train_lora.py`)
   - Load `distilgpt2` with LoRA adapters.
   - Mask prompt tokens in loss.
   - Pad/truncate sequences to 64 tokens.
   - Disable Torch Dynamo/Inductor for stability.
   - Fine-tuned 5 epochs @ 1e-5 LR.

4. Fine-Tuning Runs
   - Completed without errors.
   - Training loss ~5.0 on three examples.

5. Chat Interface (`chat.py`)
   - Maintains turn-based chat with EOS tokens.
   - Sampling: `top_p=0.9`, `temperature=0.8`.

6. Next Steps
   - Expand `chat_data.json` to 50–100 examples.
   - Curate logs and rerun LoRA tuning.
   - Move to cloud GPUs for larger models/datasets.
